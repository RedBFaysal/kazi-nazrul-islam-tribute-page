        <li><strong>1922</strong> - Nazrul reached the peak of his fame with Bidrohi (The Rebel), which remains his most famous work, winning the admiration of India's literary society for his description of a rebel. Published in the Bijli (বিজলী, "Lightning") magazine, the rebellious language and theme were well received, coinciding with the Non-Cooperation Movement – the first mass nationalist campaign of civil disobedience against British rule.</li>
        <li><strong>1923</strong> - The Police raided the office of Dhumketu after it published "Anondomoyeer Agomone" ("আনন্দময়ীর আগমনে"), a political poem, in September 1922. Nazrul was arrested on 23 January 1923 and charged with sedition.</li>

        <i>Shall I, weary of struggles, rest in quiet,
        I am the rebel eternal,
        I raise my head beyond this world and,
        High, ever erect and alone!</i>
